  "description": "*** Please remind: This preset was developed for the deprecated Facebook Graph API Version v4.0. Be aware that APIs are changing constantly, so that you may have to change things by hand. ***\n\n*** Despite the changes in the Facebook API, fetching posts still works, but with some exceptions: Facebook additionally introduced the New Page Experience, so that the API is more restricted for pages that have been migrated. See https://developers.facebook.com/docs/pages/new-pages-experience/overview/ and https://www.facebook.com/business/help/2752670058165459?id=418112142508425 for further information. ***\n\n\nAdd Facebook-IDs of pages as nodes, e.g. \"Uni.Greifswald.de\". This preset fetches the last 10 posts on a page. You can increase the limit-parameter or increade the maximum pages to get more posts.\n\nTo filter  by date use the parameters \"since\" and \"until\". The until-parameter always has to be one day later, the day starts at 0:00am GMT. For example, set since to \"2019-03-21\" and until to \"2019-03-22\" to limit the result to 21st of March 2019.\n\nIf you want more data than message, created_time and updated_time adjust the fields-parameter. Try things like: attachments, message_tags, story, permalink_url. \n\nIf you want data about reactions try the fields from the reactions preset:\n\n reactions.limit(0).summary(1), reactions.type(LIKE).limit(0).summary(1).as(like), reactions.type(LOVE).limit(0).summary(1).as(love), reactions.type(HAHA).limit(0).summary(1).as(haha), reactions.type(WOW).limit(0).summary(1).as(wow), reactions.type(SAD).limit(0).summary(1).as(sad), reactions.type(ANGRY).limit(0).summary(1).as(angry), likes.limit(0).summary(true). \n\nSee https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/v4.0/post for more options. \n\nSee https://developers.facebook.com/docs/graph-api/reference/v4.0/page/feed for an explanation of the difference between feed and posts.\n\nNotice: If you add more fields, also add them in the column setup to make the data visible in the nodes view.",
